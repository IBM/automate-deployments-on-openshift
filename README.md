![architecture](doc/source/images/architecture.png)

<!--Optionally, add flow steps based on the architecture diagram-->
## Flow

1. User checks in the code to the source control repository
2. GitHub webhook triggers an OpenShift Pipeline on the push event
3. First Tekton CI task runs to clone the code from the GitHub repository
4. Second Tekton CI task runs to build the container image from the source code. The image is then pushed to the container registry
5. Third Tekton CI task runs to update the deployment configuration with the new image and store the configuration files in the GitOps repository
6. The OpenShift GitOps picks up the configuration files from the GitOps repository and deploys to the OpenShift cluster

## 1. Setup Repositories

### 1.1. Setup source code repository

We have created a Template Repository with a sample application. You can use the sample application to complete this code pattern.

* Create a repository with [this template on GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/sample-temperature-converter-app/generate). It can be a public or private Repository.
* Once the repository is created, create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with scope=`public_repo` if its a public repository or scope=`repo` if its a private repository.
![pat-scope](doc/source/images/pat-scope.png)
    >Note: Make sure to copy your personal access token when its generated. You won’t be able to see it later!

#### About the application

The app that you see in the repository is a simple temperature converter application built with NodeJS and Express framework.

**Note:** Copy the GitHub source code repository url as it will be used in the subsequent steps.

**Note:** Copy the GitHub Personal Access Token as it will be used in the subsequent steps.

### 1.2. Setup GitOps repository

We have created a Template Repository with Helm chart for the sample application. You can use the Helm chart for the sample application to complete this code pattern.

* Create a GitOps repository with [this template on GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/sample-temperature-converter-gitops/generate). It can be a public or private Repository.
    > Note: The same personal access token that you created above will be used to access the GitOps repository.

**Note:** Copy the GitHub GitOps repository url as it will be used in the subsequent steps.

### 1.3. Setup container registry

You will need a container registry to store the container images generated by the tekton pipeline. You can use any container registry of your choice. In this code pattern, we'll show you how to create a DockerHub container registry.

* Create a [Docker ID](https://hub.docker.com/) or Login with your existing Docker ID on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
* Goto the [Account Settings > Security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) section in your Docker Hub.
* Click on **New Access Token**.
  * Enter **Access Token Description** as `tekton-pipeline`
  * Select **Access permissions** as `Read, Write, Delete`
  * Click on **Generate**.
* Copy the Access Token.
    > Note: This access token will only be displayed once. It will not be stored and cannot be retrieved. Please be sure to save it now.

**Note:** Copy the Docker Personal Access Token as it will be used in the subsequent steps.

## 2. Setup OpenShift Pipeline Operator

Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building pipelines using Tekton.

Tekton is a powerful and flexible Kubernetes-native open-source CI/CD framework, which enables automating deployments across multiple platforms (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc) by abstracting away the underlying details.
